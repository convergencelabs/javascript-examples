# Collaborative Monaco Editor

This example demonstrates a bare-bones collaborative text editor implemented with the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Monaco is a popular editor that powers Visual Studio Code.  We have developed some utilities that make using Monaco in a collaborative mode much easier. We call these the [Monaco Collaborative Extensions](https://github.com/convergencelabs/monaco-collab-extt). This example uses those extensions and integrates them with Convergence to provide a collaborative code editor in a relatively small amount of code.

Features include:
- Collaborative Text Editing
- Shared cursors
- Shared selections

Enjoy.
